Step One: NC.py.

This downloads X number of genes from each chromosome and finds their consitutuent genomic regions. This is saved for step two.

Step Two: Fractal.py

This generates the images from the fractal window.

Step Three: FractalModel.py or FractalModelSlurm.py

This creates the actual model. The reason for two files is because one is on the cluster and the other can be a local run.
