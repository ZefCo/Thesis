Step One: NC.py.

This downloads X number of genes from each chromosome and finds their consitutuent genomic regions. This is saved for step two.

Step Two: Fractal.ipynb

This generates the images from the fractal window.


Post APE:
    1) Look at Fractals of intergene regions
    2) Generate random sequences and use them.
        What is the probability distribution?
        What sections make codons?
    3) Compare Exons of a given length to Introns of a similar length
